This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Preperation

NOTE: DO NOT USE REGULARLY. ONLY USE IF ORIGINAL APPROACH FAULTERS.
```{r, echo = FALSE}
devtools::install_github('ramnathv/htmlwidgets')
```

We will also need this widget to make pretty maps:

Activate the libraries
```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(leaflet)
library(htmlwidgets)
```

Test: This was me, pasting a copy of the mapping process in the document and reoptimizing it, to depict a map of Denmark.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%                              # add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addProviderTiles("Esri.WorldImagery",       # add custom Esri World Physical map tiles
                   options = providerTileOptions(opacity=0.5)) %>%     # make the Esri tile transparent
  setView(lng = 11, lat = 56, zoom = 7)  %>%  # let's use setView to navigate to our area
  addProviderTiles("Esri.WorldPhysical", group = "Physical") %>% 
  addProviderTiles("Esri.WorldImagery", group = "Aerial") %>% 
  addProviderTiles("MtbMap", group = "Geo") %>% 

  addLayersControl(                                 # we are adding layers control to the maps
    baseGroups = c("Geo","Aerial", "Physical"),
    options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = T))
```


# Task 1: Create a Danish equivalent of AUSmap with esri layers, but call it DANmap


Focus on Denmark. Firstly, we have discovered externally, that the coordinates for Denmark are lng = 11, lat = 56 and we'll be using zoom = 7.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  setView( lng = 11, lat = 56, zoom = 7 ) %>%  # let's use setView to navigate to our area
  addProviderTiles("Esri.WorldPhysical", group = "Physical") %>% 
  addProviderTiles("Esri.WorldImagery", group = "Aerial") %>% 
  addProviderTiles("MtbMap", group = "Geo") %>% 
  addLayersControl(                                 # we are adding layers control to the maps
    baseGroups = c("Geo","Aerial", "Physical"),
    options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = T))
  
```
  

Now, prepare to select backgrounds
```{r, echo = FALSE}
esri <- grep("^Esri", providers, value = TRUE)
```

Create a basic basemap
```{r, echo = FALSE}
l_dan <- leaflet() %>%   # assign the base location to an object
  setView(11, 56, zoom = 7)
```


Select backgrounds from among provider tiles. To view them the options, 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
for (provider in esri) {
  l_dan <- l_dan %>% addProviderTiles(provider, group = provider)
  }

leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>%  # checking I am in the right area
  addProviderTiles("Esri.WorldImagery",       # add custom Esri World Physical map tiles
                   options = providerTileOptions(opacity=0.5)) %>%
  setView(11, 56, zoom = 7)

l_dan

```



#Map of Denmark
```{r, echo = FALSE}
DANmap <- l_dan %>%
  addLayersControl(baseGroups = names(esri),
                   options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = FALSE)) %>%
  addMiniMap(tiles = esri[[1]], toggleDisplay = TRUE,
             position = "bottomright") %>%
  addMeasure(
    position = "bottomleft",
    primaryLengthUnit = "meters",
    primaryAreaUnit = "sqmeters",
    activeColor = "#3D535D",
    completedColor = "#7D4479") %>% 
  htmlwidgets::onRender("
                        function(el, x) {
                        var myMap = this;
                        myMap.on('baselayerchange',
                        function (e) {
                        myMap.minimap.changeLayer(L.tileLayer.provider(e.name));
                        })
                        }") %>% 
  addControl("", position = "topright")
 

DANmap
```

Theis hjalp mig. Jeg havde et meltdown.


########## ADD DATA TO LEAFLET

# In this section you will manually create machine-readable spatial data from GoogleMaps: 

First, go to https://bit.ly/CreateCoordinates1
Enter the coordinates of your favorite leisure places in Denmark 

extracting them from the URL in googlemaps, adding name and type of monument.
Remember to copy the coordinates as a string, as just two decimal numbers separated by comma. 

Caveats: Do NOT edit the grey columns! They populate automatically!

Second, read the sheet into R. You will need gmail login information. 
watch the console, it may ask you to authenticate or put in the number 
that corresponds to the account you wish to use.

Libraries
```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(googlesheets4)
library(leaflet)
```


Read in a Google sheet
```{r, echo = FALSE}
places <- read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PlxsPElZML8LZKyXbqdAYeQCDIvDps2McZx1cTVWSzI/edit#gid=124710918",
                     col_types = "cccnncnc", range = "DM2023")
glimpse(places)
```



load the coordinates in the map and check: are any points missing? Why?
```{r, echo = FALSE}
leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addMarkers(lng = places$Longitude, 
             lat = places$Latitude,
             popup = places$Description)
```

No points are msissing for what i am aware of.

# Task 2: Read in the googlesheet data you and your colleagues populated with data into the DANmap object you created in Task 1.

This version of Danmap is updated from it's previous, by including the locational data we implemented previous.
```{r, echo = FALSE}
DANmap <- l_dan %>%
  addLayersControl(baseGroups = names(esri),
                   options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = FALSE)) %>%
  addMiniMap(tiles = esri[[1]], toggleDisplay = TRUE,
             position = "bottomright") %>%
  addMeasure(
    position = "bottomleft",
    primaryLengthUnit = "meters",
    primaryAreaUnit = "sqmeters",
    activeColor = "#3D535D",
    completedColor = "#7D4479") %>% 
  htmlwidgets::onRender("
                        function(el, x) {
                        var myMap = this;
                        myMap.on('baselayerchange',
                        function (e) {
                        myMap.minimap.changeLayer(L.tileLayer.provider(e.name));
                        })
                        }") %>% 
  addControl("", position = "topright") %>% 
  leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addMarkers(lng = places$Longitude, 
             lat = places$Latitude,
             popup = places$Placename,
             clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())
DANmap
```




# Task 3: Can you cluster the points in Leaflet? Google "clustering options in Leaflet"

YES. You cluster options for a while.

# Task 4: Look at the map and consider what it is good for and what not.

The map would be great at covering great datasets, where geographical data is of importance. Say you're mapping it out and find a pattern.
F.ex. Mapping incidents of car crashes. If car crashes occur more frequently at a specific area, that might be able to tell us something,
we might have missed if not.

# Task 5: Find out how to display notes and classifications in the map.

I did that.


# GEM Som HTML:S

```{r, echo = FALSE}
saveWidget(DANmap, "DANmap.html", selfcontained = TRUE)
```


Aflever html seperat.
